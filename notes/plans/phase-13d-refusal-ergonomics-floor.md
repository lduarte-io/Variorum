# Phase 13d — the refusal & ergonomics floor

**Status: KICKED OFF by the author 2026-07-27 evening**, at the tail of
the 13c ratify walk — her words: *"I think after this we're also fully
done with 13c and ready to go into 13d. Also - let's keep the
implementation to Orchestrator Fable, implementer Opus, and cold review
at the end fable."* **CAST (her ruling): Fable orchestrator · fresh
Opus implementer per batch · ONE Fable cold review at phase end** — the
13c K6 shape carried forward. Runs under `/architect-phase` (the
sitting-heavy walk items below want it).

## Ruled at the 13c walk — BATCH 1 (build first; all three are her fresh rulings)

1. **#43(a) — Outline opens COLLAPSED** (her overturn of the shipped
   PROVISIONAL): posts render as cards by default; expand what you work
   on. Flip the default (the 2A model tracks the collapsed set — invert
   or seed), update the pins, keep "expand all"/"collapse all".
2. **#44(c)/#45(c) — the scrubber returns to Book's spread** beside the
   leaf-turn controls (the 2B removal reverses); Read's Pages keeps its
   own. Model-driven domain as everywhere (Stage 4 lesson 8).
3. **#47(c) — Compare's related-blocks-only defaults ON**; the toggle
   reveals the full posts. Flip + pin update (the 2E narrowness pins
   must still hold).

**#34 (backspace-merge when neither block has takes, refuse-and-speak
when either does) is ruled and builds in this phase as its own batch**
— planner + merge wiring + pins; the §14 delta lands with it.

## Rolled from the 13c walk to THIS phase's sittings (open with her)

#29–#33, #36, #37, #38, #42, the minor sub-calls of #43–#47, #46's
five conversion rulings, the C3 block-extent memo's Parts 1/3, and the
long-content-panes memo's §6 — the QUESTIONS walk ledger (end of
`notes/QUESTIONS.md`) is the checklist. Resolved gates: #34, #39, #40,
#41, #43(a), #45(b) — see the 13c plan's walk record.

## Kickoff message (paste-ready for the orchestrator/coordinator the author invokes)

> You are running Variorum Phase 13d under the shape the author picks
> at kickoff (`/architect-phase` if design-heavy sittings are wanted;
> `/run-phase` if she wants it spec-driven — this plan leans simple
> enough for either). Read IN FULL first: `CLAUDE.md`,
> `notes/CoreDescription.md`, `notes/OverallModel.md`,
> `notes/AppSpec.md` (§9, §12, §14's Stage 1/Stage 2 13c deltas),
> `notes/plans/phase-13c-book-forms-and-conversions.md` (the
> constitution P-1…P-9 it carries binds 13d identically; its
> environment-traps section is current — including the 2E
> `-only-testing` false-green trap), `notes/TEXTKIT2_NOTES.md`, this
> plan, and `notes/QUESTIONS.md` #29–#47 (several 13d items depend on
> her walk's answers — see "Gates on her rulings" below). Verify the
> baselines with your own runs. Copy the P-1…P-9 constitution into
> this file verbatim at kickoff (the skill's requirement) if running
> under `/architect-phase`.

## Scope (the K3 roadmap's rows, hers verbatim from the 2026-07-25 intake ledger)

| Row | Item (hers) | Notes for the plan |
|---|---|---|
| A5 | "the callouts don't have the spacing on their color right" | Largely addressed by 13c 1A's geometry fixes + R17's rule now live; VERIFY against her walk's reaction before building more — may be done, may be a memo-Q1 conversation (the block-extent memo's Part 1 is hers, #29) |
| A9 | Divide NATIVELY in Takes (without the carry-to-Write) | The 13c sizing (#41) binds: needs a structural planning path for Takes + the W ceremony mountable outside `EditorSurfaceController`. **She may promote this to the top** — ask at kickoff |
| A11 | Divide on an empty line puts the blank line NOWHERE | Interacts with the 2026-07-12 spacing ruling (trailing newlines are content) — trace what the blank line IS before designing. **13c 1G recorded input:** the blank-run ownership rule is `SegmentationRules` (k newlines between pieces → k−1 stored on the preceding block); block-END newlines are content and durable (pinned, `TakePaneDurabilityTests`); the ONLY places whitespace is dropped are the open tail (whitespace-only never mints) and bulk-entry edge runs |
| A12 | Warning before destructive structural undos | The cheap half now that 13c built redo (its recorded pair); "destructive" needs a definition — likely "undo of a mint that had post-op edits" (the insurance class) |
| A14 | ⌘⇧Enter = new block | Registry declaration + editor wiring; check collision with existing ⌘⇧ bindings first |
| A15 | Shift-Enter stays in the block — Takes AND Write | I4-clean (newlines are content); the crystallization interaction at the open tail is the part to design |
| A16 | The newline-makes-a-block setting in Takes too (N34's GLOBAL `one_block` face) | 13b's 4D recorded the blocker: one small core setter away — read that record first |
| A22 | Typewriter room (a page of scrollable space below) | **CONFIRMED BY THE AUTHOR 2026-07-27** (*"yeah, I think we should build A22 properly in 13d"*) — ruled at the A47b sitting, where she described building the room BY HAND out of typed newlines because the app refuses to scroll past the end (the 13c plan's A47b section holds the story; it fed the void defect). MUST compose with 13c's phantom fix: 1C's record binds — deliberate room must be REAL space the caret can enter, or it feels exactly like the phantom she hated. Read `LongBlockLayout.swift`, the C3 memo, AND the 13c Batch 1G record first. **1G's recorded input on how typed end-of-post whitespace ACTUALLY behaves:** newlines typed at a BLOCK's end (mid-post included) are content, stored byte-exact, durable through every ordinary path (experiment-pinned); newlines typed past the LAST block are open-tail entry and a whitespace-only tail NEVER MINTS — it renders for the session and evaporates at teardown without ever reaching the store (`idleMintTail`/`finalizeWork` both guard `!tail.allSatisfy(\.isWhitespace)` — the ratified Phase 7 rules). So hand-built room LOOKS durable and silently vanishes — the surface-vs-store disagreement that seeded A47b. A22's design must give room that is either real non-content scroll allowance or genuinely durable; her "should we just stop trimming?" question + the architect's recommendation (keep the edge rules, build A22 as the real answer) are recorded in the 13c plan's A47b section, HER ruling deliberately untaken until this sitting |
| A23 | Setting: paragraph-tall gap between blocks | Pure presentation (the 2026-07-12 ruling's presentation half); a Settings face over the uniform gap |
| A24 | Different levels of spellchecking | TEXTKIT2 §3 warns: continuous spell check + completion has crashed TK2 — keep the toggle coarse and test the crash class |

## Gates on her rulings (do not build past these before the walk)

- **#34** (texted-seam backspace-merge): if she rules (ii)/(iii), that
  build lands HERE — it is the floor's biggest item and pairs with A12.
- **#40** (named/callout empty carve): one guard line if she flips it.
- **#41** (A9's promotion): her call on where it sits in this phase.
- **#43(a)** (Outline's open-by-default): one line if she flips it.
- The C3 block-extent memo's Parts 1/3 (#29) — A5's real scope depends
  on her answers.

## Verification

Per-batch: the standing loop (build → pins → the tutorial spine green →
full suites, counts confirmed by the "Test run with N tests" line —
never a bare SUCCEEDED). Phase-end: the review shape the author sets at
kickoff. Red-on-old absolute; the hallucination guard binds; every
PROVISIONAL to `notes/QUESTIONS.md` (append, never renumber — next
free number at authoring time: #48).

## Environment

The 13c plan's environment-traps section binds by reference (instance
discipline incl. discriminate-by-path; no Release builds/refreshes
beside a live instance; WAL-safe UTC-named backups before touching the
real store; suite-level `-only-testing` only, with the run-line proof;
zsh `pipestatus`; never a custom build configuration; the sandboxed
test host's scratchpad limitation; the worktree-must-be-named-
`variorum` SPM note from the 13c refresh record).
