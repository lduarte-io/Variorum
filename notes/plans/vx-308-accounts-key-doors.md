# VX-308 — Castle rebuild, phase 4: accounts and the key doors

**Status: PLANNED — written 2026-10-19 at VX-307's settling sitting (her rulings of that sitting are QUESTIONS #235's
HER RULINGS block and this plan's §1). Kicks off at her word with `/architect-phase vx-308` in a fresh session; holds
the one Sync/-or-custody slot.** The VX-308 TICKET'S BODY and its comment carry the hand-forwards; the core acts and
the WIRE are BUILT (VX-378 + VX-307 U1) — this phase is their FACES, the key doors, and the riders.

> **KICKOFF MESSAGE (paste-ready).** STEP 0: the bout ritual (pull both repos, `Tools/vx sync`), then from
> `~/dev/variorum` on `main`: `git worktree add -b vx-308-accounts-key-doors ~/dev/variorum-vx-308 origin/main`; push
> the branch; the in-flight row (HOLDS the Sync/-custody slot); Linear VX-308 → In Progress; announce to the stage
> coordinator. **Read first, in full:** CLAUDE.md + its canon; `notes/SessionResiliencyProtocol.md`;
> `notes/CastleRules.md` (rules 7, 10, 12, 14–16 are this phase's heart); `notes/SyncSpec.md` WHOLE; the lifecycle
> page stages 10 and 12; `notes/plans/vx-307-castle-crossings.md` §6 (the U1 RECORD — how the wire is consumed — the
> U2a/U2b records, the arbitrations, THE WALK RECORD's machinery notes) and §5a's hard limits (they bind here
> verbatim); `notes/SurfaceContracts.md`'s protection section; the VX-308 ticket's comment (the hand-forwards); the
> core's `Acts/AccountActs.swift`, `Acts/Follow.swift`, `Acts/KeyDoors.swift`, `Assess/Assessment.swift`,
> `Protection/Wire/AccountVaultClient.swift`, `App/Variorum/Shared/Protection/` (the faces' homes).
>
> **The one law:** the new road stays DEBUG-ONLY; `SyncSchema.lockstepVersion` STAYS 13; the mirror artifact
> `17_phase_vx307_vault.sql` stays HELD (her ruling — the deploy + marker 14 ride VX-329's release). **THE WALK FACT
> the kickoff call needs:** the LIVE mirror still speaks marker 13 WITHOUT the new vault columns, and the new client
> refuses a mode-less row (`preLockstepRow`) BY DESIGN — so a live throwaway-account walk CANNOT run against the
> production mirror. Her kickoff call is therefore: (a) the account arms stand on the two-client fake-server suites
> alone (the VX-307 precedent), or (b) a SEPARATE throwaway Supabase project with the held artifact applied THERE
> (her accounts and hands; the production mirror untouched). **THE ORCHESTRATOR'S RECOMMENDATION, HER STANDING
> ACCEPTANCE AT THE VX-307 SETTLING SITTING PENDING HER KICKOFF WORD: (b), framed as the ARTIFACT'S DRESS REHEARSAL
> first and the walk second** — three consecutive lockstep deploys (13j's 42702 parameter shadow, 13y's run-1 grant
> refusal, 13i-a's missing definer DML grant) had LIVE-ONLY PL/pgSQL and grant findings the fake server cannot reach,
> and artifact 17 has never run on real Postgres; a throwaway project catches that class now, cheaply, instead of at
> VX-329's release window with her live client waiting. **The overnight-safe convention:** the kickoff session checks
> `~/.variorum/dev-vault-throwaway.env` (expected keys: `VARIORUM_THROWAWAY_PROJECT_URL`,
> `VARIORUM_THROWAWAY_ANON_KEY`, `VARIORUM_THROWAWAY_PAT`; values never committed or echoed — the dev-castle.env
> discipline, and note the file's lines need `export` or the session exports explicitly). File PRESENT → run the
> rehearsal (the artifact applied to the throwaway, every checklist row exercised, findings amended into the artifact)
> and the account-arm walk against it, Debug-only, the vault client alone pointed there (the row-sync engine stays
> off; the dev store's restore hold stands). File ABSENT → fake-server-only (option a), and the rehearsal lands as a
> bundled morning item with the five-minute setup note. Either way the phase closes; the rehearsal is additive
> evidence, never a gate she has to be awake for. Hard limits otherwise as §5a's: no not-pursued items,
> both secrets where the rules say, keychain tests under throwaway scopes, headless + build-for-testing for
> implementers, the orchestrator runs Mac suites and walks under the stage.

## 1. Her rulings standing at this plan's writing (2026-10-19)
- **VX-445 joins this phase** (the lock on the new road — Castle's idle lock and Lock Now; NIT-R2-1's by-library
  export-notice mark rides it).
- **VX-447 and VX-448 are riders** (the no-key-file banner becomes the door + the act proceeds on a file-less
  library; the clipboard's concealed-type + clear-at-lock/quit — the timer and the restore go).
- The guide chapters are NOT this phase's (VX-309's, her ruling); the walk question is HERS at kickoff (above).

## 2. The members (the ledger; the kickoff session cuts the units)
| Ticket | What closes it here |
|---|---|
| **VX-418** | THE ACCOUNT FACES: sync setup hands the pair up; the join ("your library's twelve words are now your account's twelve words; here they are; the old ones still open backups you made before today" — the "here they are" edge P-VX378-U2-3 is hers to eye); the follow in/out of Castle (the quiet out-notice's face, the replaced-key catch-up); leave the account (rule 16's three doors). The core acts + wire are built; faces only. |
| **VX-107** | The follow's facts survive the double-crash (core built); the Done's other-device sentence on the new face |
| **VX-113** | The face says *Your passphrase was changed on [device] on [day]* (core refusal `passphraseChangedElsewhere` built) |
| **VX-239 / VX-243** | ONE presenter for the protection sheets; an in-flight act's sheet never re-presents after unlock |
| **VX-264** | Her #216 rulings: the signed-out screens, the leaving/joining words |
| **VX-314** | New writing belongs to the library's account, not whoever is signed in |
| **The key doors** | Change Passphrase / New Words / the forgot road on the new road; library and account locks change together (rule 7); VX-263's sentences → one line each: *your current secrets open everything you've made of this library* |
| **VX-445** | The new road's relock: idle lock + Lock Now through the road session; NIT-R2-1's mark-by-library rides |
| **VX-447 · VX-448** | The riders (her rulings above) |
| Hand-forwards | F-4 (the restore hold's gate on synced crossings); the F-U2c-5 synced-banner variant folds into VX-447 |

## 3. LIVE STATUS
- not started (the kickoff session owns this file from its STEP 0).
